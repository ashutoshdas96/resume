# Ashutosh Das Résumé [![Résumé](https://img.shields.io/badge/example-pdf-green.svg)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ashutoshdas96/resume/master/Ashutosh_Das_Resume.pdf)



This templete is based on [**Awesome CV**](https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV) which is a LaTeX template for a **CV(Curriculum Vitae)** or **resume** or **cover letter** inspired by [Fancy CV](https://www.sharelatex.com/templates/cv-or-resume/fancy-cv). It is easy to customize your own template, especially since it is really written by a clean, semantic markup. I have used this as a base templete and modified it according to my need.
